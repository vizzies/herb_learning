High aspect ratio wings provide additional lift and drag reduction for a proposed multi-propulsor design, however, the challenge is to reduce the weight of wing structures while maintaining adequate structural and aeroelastic margins. Design exploration using a conventional design-and-build philosophy coupled with a finite element method (FEM)-based design of experiments (DOE) strategy are presented to examine high aspect ratio wing structures that have spanwise distributed electric motors. Multiple leading-edge-mounted engine masses presented a challenge to design a wing within acceptable limits for dynamic and aeroelastic stability. Because the first four primary bending eigenmodes of the proposed wing structure are very sensitive to outboard motor placement, safety-of-flight requirements drove the need for multiple spars, rib attachments, and outboard structural reinforcements in the design. Global aeroelasticity became an increasingly important design constraint during the on-going design process, with outboard motor pod flutter ultimately becoming a primary design constraint. Designers successively generated models to examine stress, dynamics, and aeroelasticity concurrently. This research specifically addressed satisfying multi-disciplinary design criteria to generate fluid-structure interaction solution sets, and produced high aspect ratio primary structure designs for the NASA Scalable Convergent Electric Propulsion Technology and Operations Research (SCEPTOR) project in the Aeronautic Research Mission Directorate at NASA. In this paper, a dynamics-driven, quasi-inverse design methodology is presented to address aerodynamic performance goals and structural challenges encountered for the SCEPTOR demonstrator vehicle. These results are compared with a traditional computer aided design based approach.']"
